# # # Pixel Dungeon Of Teller
Greetings and this is another mod of SPD.I have to note that this project have a rather long way to what is called 'formal version' so it might be a bad choice for a playing fun during a long time.

This is New version of Pixel Dungeon Of Teller with Libgdx code base!Old version can be found at here:https://github.com/1015561267/Pixel_Dungeon_Of_Teller
# # Highlights:
* Overrided damage system(not in total use yet)
* A large increase amount of weapons(still not enough and many needs to be replaced)
* Self-mod able magic book replaces wand(in work and have a long way to go)
* Stealth,AI change and assassin equipment to make use of that(not finished yet and need a lot of polishing)
* NOT REALIZED SYSTEM,like overrided rings and artficates,rework upgrade,imbue and weightstone imerged into a highly combined and controlable one
* A lot of bugs,and more bugs(yeah that's the most important content)

# # Notice:
Remember that this dungeon have a long way to go. Not recommended for playing but I really need some testing and bug reports so...here it is. Myself may lack talent in balancing
and drawing(coding also,might be)and I just cannot refuse new and also useful update in SPD and other dungeons(like 2.5D and muliti-save slots)So this one would need a much 
longer time to really reach a impressive version,much longer than you can expected,seriously. I only have the time for Chinese text,after the so-called-formal version is out I 
would be able to concentrate on other language support.I would be more than honored if get help on translation,but still have to mention it's not at high properties,not yet.

# # Contact:
I'm in lack of almost everything,from pictures to data and design,even time to code.So if you want to take part in its creation or just report a bug(also long delay before update might be)can contact me by e-mail,in English or Chinese.
